    This function works with integer graph (nodes are integers starting from
    0 and form an interval without holes). If the given graph is non-integer

    after the end of the computation. For this reason nodes of `graph` **must**
    be hashable objects.

        Using a non integer graph and setting `is_integer_graph` to `True`
        will probably make the function fail with an exception, or, even worse,

    :param is_integer_graph: If `True`, we do not check if the given graph is
        integer (saves time). If `is_integer_graph` is `True` but the graph
        is not integer the output may be wrong. Defaults to False.
